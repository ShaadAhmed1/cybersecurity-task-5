# cybersecurity-task-5

Objective
This repository contains the deliverables for Task 5 of the Cybersecurity Internship with Elevate Labs. The objective was to perform a hands-on packet capture and analysis using Wireshark to identify basic protocols and traffic types on a live network.

Tools Used
Wireshark: A free, open-source network protocol analyzer.

Steps Performed
Wireshark Installation: Installed Wireshark on the local machine.

Packet Capture: Started a packet capture on the active network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi).

Traffic Generation: Generated network traffic by browsing website.

Capture Stop: Stopped the capture after approximately one minute to gather a sufficient amount of data.

Packet Filtering: Used Wireshark's display filters to isolate specific protocols.

Protocol Identification: Identified and documented at least three different protocols from the captured traffic.

Exporting: Exported the captured packets as a .pcap file.

Protocols Identified
Based on the captured traffic, the following protocols were identified and analyzed:

DNS
TCP
